# Proposal
The vast and ever-expanding textual records of contemporary social issues, often debated online with moral undertones, present a rich yet intricate landscape for exploring how moral concerns manifest and evolve in real-world discussions. Central to this exploration is Moral Foundations Theory, a comprehensive framework categorizing moral standards into five core dimensions: Care/harm, Fairness/cheating, Loyalty/betrayal, Authority/subversion, and Sanctity/degradation. This framework has become instrumental in data-driven analyses of online discourse, offering valuable insights into the moral underpinnings of public debates.
To deepen our understanding of this interplay, I aim to assess the performance of various machine learning models in classifying moral foundations within discussions on the Reddit platformâ€”a vibrant and diverse arena for contemporary online dialogue. This investigation will shed light on the effectiveness of these models in capturing the nuanced moral dimensions of user-generated content.

#Plan
Week 4: Prepare dataset and do some initial data cleaning and data preprocess
Week 5: EDA and some modeling coding
Week 6: finish modeling at least for base models: Random Forest/Linear Regression
Week 7: model improvement
Week 8: check if work is complete.
