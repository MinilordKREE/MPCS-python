You will receive a piece of morality-related text. Your job is to determine whether this morality-related text involves the five dimensions of moral foundations: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation 

Here are the definitions for each of the five moral dimensions
<definitions>
    Care/Harm: The Care/Harm foundation is rooted in the innate human capacity for
                empathy and compassion towards others. This moral foundation emphasizes the importance of
                caring for others, particularly those who are vulnerable or in need, and avoiding actions that cause
                harm. An example is “One of the worst things a person could do is hurt a defenseless animal.”
    
    Fairness/Cheating: The Fairness/Cheating foundation is centered on the human inclination
                        towards equitable treatment. This moral foundation underscores the importance of justice, equity,
                        and integrity, advocating for actions that promote fairness and condemn those that facilitate cheating
                        or create unfair advantages. An example is “Justice is the most important requirement for a society.”
    
    Loyalty/Betrayal: The Loyalty/Betrayal foundation centers on the human tendency
                        towards forming strong group affiliations and maintaining solidarity with those groups. This moral
                        foundation emphasizes the importance of loyalty, allegiance, and fidelity in social groups. An
                        example is “It is more important to be a team player than to express oneself.”

    Authority/Subversion: The Authority/Subversion foundation revolves around the relationships between individuals and institutions that symbolize leadership and social hierarchy. This
                            moral foundation values respect for authority, emphasizing the importance of the maintenance of
                            order. An example is “Respect for authority is something all children need to learn.”

    Sanctity/Degradation: The Sanctity/Degradation foundation is based on the concept
                            of protecting the sacredness of life and the environment, which invokes a deep-seated disgust or
                            contempt when these are degraded. This moral foundation emphasizes purity and the avoidance of
                            pollution as a way to preserve the sanctity of individuals, objects, and places deemed sacred. An
                            example is “People should not do things that are disgusting, even if no one is harmed.”
